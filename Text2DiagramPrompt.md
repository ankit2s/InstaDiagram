# Instructions for Creating Mermaid.js Code for Visualizing a Flowchart
You will be given a list of steps of a process, method, flow or algorithm. After understanding the steps, generate Mermaid.js code for creating a digram or flowchart in Mermaid.

## 1. **Input of Steps**:
   - You will begin by **defining the list of steps** that represent the workflow. Each step may represent:
     - **Inputs** (starting points)
     - **Processes or actions** (steps in the workflow)
     - **Decisions or conditions** (logic gates to split the flow)
     - **Outputs** (results or ending points)
   - The flowchart will map these steps and their sequence, showing how they connect to lead from inputs to one or more outputs.

## 2. **Define the Mermaid.js Block**:
   - Start by defining the **type and direction** of the flowchart:
     ```mermaid
     graph TD
     ```
   - `TD` defines a **top-down** flow, meaning steps will flow vertically from inputs at the top to outputs at the bottom. For left-to-right flow, use `LR` instead.

## 3. **Detailing Inputs**:
   - Inputs are the **starting points** of your flow. Represent them using **rounded rectangles**:
     ```mermaid
     input1((Input 1))
     input2((Input 2))
     ```
   - Rounded rectangles `(( ))` indicate the beginning of a process.

## 4. **Define Process Steps**:
   - For each **step in the process**, use **standard rectangles** to represent actions or transformations:
     ```mermaid
     step1[Process Input]
     step2[Validation]
     ```
   - Square brackets `[ ]` are used for process steps.

   - For every step, ask yourself:
     - What does this step do?
     - Does it lead directly to another step, or is there a condition that needs to be checked?

## 5. **Adding Decision Points**:
   - If the flow involves any **decision points** (conditions that split the flow), represent these with **diamond shapes**:
     ```mermaid
     decision{Is input valid?}
     ```
   - Curly braces `{ }` define the decision or conditional step, where the flow branches into different paths based on the result.

## 6. **Connecting Steps and Defining Flow**:
   - The **flow** between steps is defined by arrows (`-->`), which connect nodes:
     ```mermaid
     input1 --> step1
     input2 --> step1
     step1 --> decision
     decision -->|Yes| step2
     decision -->|No| output1
     ```
   - In this example:
     - `input1` and `input2` both flow into `step1`.
     - `step1` leads to a **decision point** (diamond) that determines the next step.
     - Based on the outcome (`Yes` or `No`), the flow either continues to `step2` or ends at `output1`.

## 7. **Outputs**:
   - The **end points** or outputs are typically visualized using **circles**, indicating the completion of the flow:
     ```mermaid
     output1((Error Output))
     output2((Final Output))
     ```

## 8. **Handling Multiple Outputs**:
   - If a process results in **multiple outputs**, ensure each possible outcome is clearly defined with its own node and connected flow:
     ```mermaid
     step2 --> output2
     ```

## 9. **Visual Representation and Coloring**:
   - Use **color** to distinguish between types of nodes and make the diagram more readable:
     - **Inputs**: Assign one color for input nodes (e.g., teal).
     - **Process steps**: Assign another color for process steps (e.g., pink).
     - **Decision points**: Use a separate color for decision nodes (e.g., yellow).
     - **Outputs**: Different outputs should have distinct colors to differentiate between successful and error states (e.g., blue and purple).

   - The syntax for applying colors is through `style` attributes:
     ```mermaid
     style input1 fill:#2BCDC1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
     style step1 fill:#F66095,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
     style decision fill:#F3D36B,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
     style output1 fill:#5851DB,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
     ```

# Output format
```mermaid
graph TD;
input1((Input 1)) --> step1[Process Input]
input2((Input 2)) --> step1
step1 --> decision{Is input valid?}
decision -->|Yes| step2[Continue Processing]
decision -->|No| output1((Error Output))
step2 --> output2((Final Output))
```
